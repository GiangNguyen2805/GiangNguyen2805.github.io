    <h1>Giang Nguyen</h1>

    <h4> I am a 17 years old girl and I am about to walk into the real world. So choosing a right career path can be tough. Especially, when my parents are involved. But since I know what I want to be, it is not to much hard for me when I fill my application. I want to be an engineer, a job that required someone to be good at math and know how to solve the problem quickly. I think the first step of being a successful engineer is to have a systematic and efficient learning. It is very important for a student to understand the fundamentals and basic principles of engineering. By memorizing and copying out things might help me to remember notes, but I know that these only just work for a short period. So I need to set out to understand the meaning of what I have to learn instead of concentrate my time repeating things, which are surface approach to learning.
    <h4> I am an ambitious young woman and I could say I do have a little bit of creative mind in my brain because I have a lot of ideas about my future. Although I know that sometimes, the future that comes to me will be completely different with what I was planning but it just me, preparing for the real world before stepping out of Palm Desert High School's gate. Everyone can agree that I am a good student. Besides I could say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Besides, my friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor.  I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.
