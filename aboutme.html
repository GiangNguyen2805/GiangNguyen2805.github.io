    <h1>Giang Nguyen</h1>

    <h4> I am a 17 years old girl and I am about to walk into the real world. So choosing a right career path can be tough. Especially, when my parents are involved. But since I know what I want to be, it is not to much hard for me when I fill my application. I want to be an engineer, a job that required someone to be good at math and know how to solve the problem quickly. I think the first step of being a successful engineer is to have a systematic and efficient learning. It is very important for an engineer to understand the fundamentals and basic principles of engineering. By memorizing and copying out things might help me to remember notes, but I know that these only just work for a short period. So I need to set out to understand the meaning of what I have to learn instead of concentrate my time repeating things, which are surface approach to be an engineer. Moreover, after I finishing my 4 years of university, I want to learn as much from others' experience. I believe that even though, books are one of the source that could be trusted the most but actually, not everything is in the books. So learning from others that have long time experiences are one of the master key tools that I want to have. Later on, I want my colleagues, my manager or even my boss to see my potential and that everyday I could walk into the office with a happy mind.
    <h4> I am an ambitious person and I could say I do have a little bit of creative mind in my brain because I have a lot of ideas about my future. Although I know that sometimes, the future that comes to me will be completely different with what I was planning but it just me, preparing for the real world before stepping out of Palm Desert High School's gate. Everyone can agree that I am a good student. Besides I could say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Furthermore, I always improve my ability so that I could work better for the next time. One of thing that I proud of myself the most is that I have a problem solving sills. In another words, solve problems in an effective and timely manner without any impediments. I believe that this will make me easily noticed, recognized, and appreciated by others.
    <h4> Moreover, my friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor.  I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.
