    <h1>Kristen Nguyen</h1>
    
    <h4> I am 17 years old and I am about to go to college as everyone else. I enjoy being with people than rather be by myself. I do not like to isolate myself in the crowd. Nowadays, I enjoy going hiking with my mom every Sunday. At first although I hate it, but when I climbed to the top, it was so peaceful and refreshing.</h4>
